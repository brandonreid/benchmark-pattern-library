The less folder in here is a direct copy of app/less in benchmark-client. The reason it's placed in this benchmark_less subfolder is so that the file paths that import from bootstrap or the fonts folder are maintained.

It must remain up to date with the app's less folder, so feel free to just delete this one and replace it with a copy from benchmark-client at any time.

Library specific styles are in the css/main.less file in this repo's root folder.
