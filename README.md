# benchmark-pattern-library
A library of UI patterns for use in the Benchmark Intelligence analytics platform.

## Getting Started
### Install Dependencies
#### Jekyll
To do this you'll need Ruby installed and some other stuff, follow the [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
#### Jekyll Less
`[sudo] gem install jekyll-less`  

For Jekyll Less, you'll also need:  

`[sudo] gem install therubyracer`

#### CSS Autoprefixer
`[sudo] gem install octopress-autoprefixer`

### Starting Dev Environment
`cd` into the pattern library repo after you clone it.  
Run `jekyll serve` to start your local server and initiate watches.  
Go to `http://localhost:4000/`. When you make a change, Jekyll will recompile automatically, but you will have to refresh your browser to see the changes.
